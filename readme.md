- This tools helps making proxy cards in a printable format without laborious manual work.
- Currently only work for the output of EDHREC, but I did not check other sites' format.

## Objective

I'd like to create a web tool that helps printing proxy MTG cards easily from a list as following format, which is direct paste from EDHREC from clipboard export.

```
Blasphemous Edict
Entomb
Ghalta, Primal Hunger
Kagha, Shadow Archdruid
Lord of Extinction
Old Stickfingers
Overlord of the Balemurk
Reanimate
Titanoth Rex
```

This will generate a PDF file that has the exact size of MTG card to print.
